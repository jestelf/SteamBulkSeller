# Steam Bulk Seller

If you're like me, you don't care much about custom emoji or whatever collecting Steam Trading Cards get you. Instead, you can sell each of the cards for about 10Â¢ each. If you've got an inventory with hundreds of cards, this can make you enough money (in Steam store credit) to buy a few cheap games.

This small JavaScript snippet automatically sells all of the Steam trading cards in your inventory. It sells them for the median price of each card for the past week's sales.

This script works well with [IdleMaster](http://steamidlemaster.com/), a program you can leave running to get all possible Steam trading cards from your games.

## How to use

- Log into Steam on [the Steam website](https://steamcommunity.com/login):

- Go to your inventory:

From here you can either create a bookmarklet or manually input the file contents.

### Bookmarklet (easiest option)
- Go to [this page](https://milkey-mouse.github.io/SteamBulkSeller/) to "install" the bookmarklet.
- Go back to the Steam page and click on the new bookmark.
- Wait while it sells all the cards. It should only take 60 seconds or so.

### Manual input
- On the Steam inventory page, press `F12` to open the dev console and switch to the tab marked "Console". This works on all major browsers, but the screenshot is of Chrome:

- Paste the contents of [this file](https://github.com/milkey-mouse/SteamBulkSeller/blob/master/steam-bulk-sell.js) after the caret in the console and press enter.
- Wait while it sells all the cards. It should only take 60 seconds or so.
